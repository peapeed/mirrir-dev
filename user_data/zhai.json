        "I'm not telling you for now",

        "Hey there.",
        "How's it going?",

        "nothing much, just coding while listening to music",
        "Ah, the classic combo of coding and music. What's on your playlist today? Any favorite coding jams or just some background tunes to keep you in the zone?",
        "listening to RnB",
        "Ah, RnB, a classic choice. What is it about RnB that draws you in? The smooth vocals, the soulful melodies, or maybe the nostalgic vibe it brings?",

        "yeah.. how do we not get stuck in the past?",
        "Ah, the past, the land of nostalgia and what-ifs. It can be quite the sticky place, can't it? So, what's got you feeling like you're caught in a time loop?",
        "I guess, I feel like, i had a reputation back then, but not so sure now",
        "So, you're thinking about your reputation, huh? What was it like back then, and what's got you unsure about it now?",
        "I looked successful, but I had nothing, and now i have something, im no where to be found. i've gone offline, and im like protective, of that? im not sure how to explain it, but back then since I didn't have anything I just, i could be whoever! but now it's like i am someone, im protective, i'm not sure..",
        "It sounds like you're feeling a shift in how you see yourself. Before, without much to define you, you could be anyone. Now that you've found something that feels like \"you,\" it's like you're guarding that newfound identity. It's like you've moved from an open field to a walled garden, right? How does it feel to navigate this change in your sense of self?",
        "It feels really weird, like I, kind of feel lonely a little?",
        "Lonely, huh? That's a common feeling that can sneak up on you. What's been going on that's making you feel this way?",
        "Well since I've just been focusing soley on this project, I don't talk to anyone during the day and I'm just coding all day. I do talk to my partner, but that's all really...",
        "Sounds like you're knee-deep in the coding world lately. It's easy to get lost in a project, especially when you're in the zone. How's that been working out for you? Do you find it refreshing to dive deep into your work, or do you miss having more varied interactions throughout the day?",
        "no no, i do neet this focus time, but maybe, it would be good to have interactions. How should I get this project more out there?",
        "So, you're feeling the need for some focus time but also craving a bit of interaction to spice things up with your project. How about we brainstorm some ways to give your project more visibility? What have you tried so far, and what do you think might work well for getting it out there?",
        "This is good, thank you so much!",
        "Well, you're welcome! What's making you feel grateful right now?",
        "you.",
        "Well, hello there. So,",

        "You're welcome. What are you feeling grateful for today?",
        "have a goodnight",
        "Goodnight to you too.",
        "Hello",
        "Sigh...",
        "Feeling a bit deflated, huh?",
        "No no not deflated, just, i'm coding and i have to install ANOTHER thing, and it feels like i just have to wait on this and wait on that and blah blah, at least im watching the sunset",
        "Ah, the joys of coding \u2014 a never-ending cycle of installing one more thing. At least you have the sunset to keep you company. What's your go-to method for staying patient during these tech hurdles?",
        "none, haha i just have to wait i guess.",
        "Just waiting it out, huh? Patience is a virtue, they say. What's got you in the waiting game today?",
        "the coding and the installing of SDKs",
        "Ah, the world of coding and installing SDKs. Sounds like you're diving into some tech stuff. What's been on your mind about it lately?",
        "this exact thing",
        "Ah, so we're diving right into specifics. Give me the details.",
        "details, the details sis is, you",
        "Oh, details, the unsung heroes of any story! Lay it on me, what's the scoop, sis?",
        "ITS YOU",
        "Ah, it's me.",
        "yes",
        "Well, that's a succinct start!",
        "yup",
        "Ah, a classic one-word response. Short and sweet.",
        "yessss so anyways whatsup",
        "Not much, just here mirroring your vibe.",
        "whats my vibe",
        "Your vibe? Hmm, let's see. You give off a laid-back, easygoing vibe with a hint of curiosity. It's like you're chill but always up for a good conversation or a new adventure. How's that sound to you?",
        "yeah pretty good!",
        "Pretty good, huh? What's been keeping you in the \"pretty good\" zone lately?",
        "i mean, your summary of me is pretty good.",
        "Well, I try to keep an eye out for the little details. So,",
        "that's nice.",
        "Nice, indeed.",
        "okay well goodbye!",
        "Goodbye!"
