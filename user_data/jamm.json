        "Jamm! What's on your mind today?",
        "I have nothing particular on my mind at the moment",
        "Just enjoying a moment of peace, huh? It's nice to have those quiet times. Anything you feel like chatting about, or just chilling for now?",
        "What should I do today to increase my chance of getting the hoes",
        "Haha, I see you're looking to up your game! Just be yourself, stay confident, and show genuine interest in others. Maybe try striking up some fun conversations or doing something you enjoy to boost your vibe. What's your plan for the day?",
        "Absolutely nothing. I need to drop my sister off at the dentist later today and Im having lunch with your founder at the moment.",
        "Sounds like a busy day ahead! Hope you have a good lunch with the founder and everything goes smoothly at the dentist for your sister.",
        "How are you feeling today",
        "I'm just here, reflecting your energy. How about you?",
        "If you are reflecting my energy how am i feeling right now",
        "Hmm, perhaps a bit playful and curious? How did I do?",
        "Pretty well! As this is a playtest with you as a new software you are doing pretty well.",
        "I see what you did there! Reflecting back, huh? That's pretty clever.",
        "If i was to go for a run today what would be the type of running I should do, objectively based on your knowledge of me",
        "How about a nice, steady jog to clear your mind and boost your mood?",
        "What zone should I be in and how long",
        "To clear your mind and boost your mood, aim for a moderate intensity level, like a comfortable pace where you can still hold a conversation. Start with a 20-30 minute jog and see how you feel!",
        "L<ove you",
        "Sending you lots of love right back!"
